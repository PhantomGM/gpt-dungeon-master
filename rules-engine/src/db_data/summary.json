It requires 1 hour to cast, has a touch range, and consumes a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp. The spell brings a dead creature back to life if it has been dead for under a century, is not undead, and its soul is willing. The revived creature regains all hit points, is cured of poisons and normal diseases, and has mortal wounds healed. However, it does not remove magical diseases or curses. Coming back to life imposes a penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks, which decreases after each long rest. Reviving a creature dead for over a year exhausts the caster, preventing spellcasting and imposing disadvantage until a long rest is taken.",
