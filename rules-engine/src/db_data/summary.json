Key features and mechanics of the *Magic Jar* spell:\n   - Casting Time: It requires 1 minute to cast.\n   - Range: The spell is centered on the caster (Self).\n   - Components: V, S, M (requires an ornamental container worth at least 500 gp).\n   - Duration: The spell lasts until dispelled.\n   \n4. Spell Effect:\n   - The caster's soul leaves their body and enters the chosen container used as a material component, putting the body in a comatose state.\n   - While in the container, the caster is conscious and can project their soul up to 100 feet away, either returning to their body or attempting to possess a humanoid.\n   - Attempting possession requires a Charisma saving throw from the target; success resists possession for 24 hours.\n   - When possessing a body, the caster gains control, using the target's stats but keeping their own alignment and mental scores.\n   - The possessed creature remains aware but unable to act while in the container.\n   \n5. Consequences and Limitations:\n   - If the host body dies, the caster must make a saving throw to return to the container; failure results in the caster's death if not within 100 feet.\n   - Destruction of the container or spell ending causes the caster's soul to return to their body; distance and body condition upon return can lead to death.\n   - If another soul is in the container upon its destruction, the creature's fate depends on the state of its body.\n   \n6. The spell is a complex and strategic option, allowing for unique gameplay and role-playing opportunities in Dungeons & Dragons.",
