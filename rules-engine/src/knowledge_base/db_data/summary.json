There are three types of madness: short-term, long-term, and indefinite, each with different effects on the character's behavior. \n\n- **Short-Term Madness**: Lasting for 1d10 minutes, it can cause effects such as paralysis, incapacitation, fear, babbling, hallucinations, and more.\n  \n- **Long-Term Madness**: Lasting for 1d10 x 10 hours, it includes effects like compulsive behaviors, paranoia, delusions, tremors, amnesia, and more.\n\n- **Indefinite Madness**: This type gives the character a lasting flaw until cured, like adopting someone else's mannerisms, constantly lying, or believing powerful enemies are after them.\n\nThese madness effects can add depth and challenge to a campaign, particularly in horror-themed adventures, where characters may encounter extraordinary and nightmarish threats. Dungeon Masters can use the madness rules to enhance the psychological toll of the adventurers' experiences.",

When adventurers encounter a trap, they need to detect, disable, or avoid it. Traps are triggered by various mechanisms like pressure plates or spells. Characters can detect traps through observation or checks, with varying DCs for detection and disarmament. Magic traps can be disarmed with checks like Intelligence (Arcana) or by using spells like *dispel magic*. Trap effects range from inconvenience to lethality, utilizing elements like poison, blades, and fire. The severity of traps is categorized as Setback, Dangerous, or Deadly, with varying save DCs and attack bonuses based on character levels. Complex traps function like standard traps but have multiple actions each round, resembling combat encounters.",

When triggered, the net covers a 10-foot-square area, restraining creatures underneath. A failed DC 10 Strength saving throw knocks creatures prone. Creatures can use their action to free themselves or others with a DC 10 Strength check.

Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save. Detecting the trap requires a DC 15 check or using magic sensing effects like *detect magic*.

Wearing armor without proficiency results in disadvantages on certain rolls and prevents spellcasting.\n- **Armor Class (AC)**: The armor worn dictates the character's base Armor Class, which determines how well they are protected from attacks.\n- **Heavy Armor**: Heavier armor like plate armor can slow down movement unless the character meets the required Strength score.\n- **Stealth**: Some armor types impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, affecting the character's ability to move quietly.\n- **Shields**: Shields boost Armor Class by 2 but limit the character to using only one at a time.\n\n### Light Armor\nLight armor, such as Padded, Leather, and Studded Leather, offers minimal protection but allows for better mobility. Characters add their Dexterity modifier to the base AC when wearing light armor.\n\n- **Padded**: Consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\n- **Leather**: Made from boiled leather with flexible materials for comfort.\n- **Studded Leather**: Tough leather reinforced with rivets or spikes.\n\n### Medium Armor\nMedium armor, like Hide, provides more protection but restricts movement compared to light armor.

This customization does not affect the NPC's challenge rating.\n\n- **Armor and Weapon Swaps:** NPCs' armor and weapons can be upgraded, downgraded, added, or switched, affecting their Armor Class and damage. These changes may alter the NPC's challenge rating.\n\n- **Magic Items:** NPCs, especially powerful ones, may possess magic items like staves, wands, potions, and scrolls.
