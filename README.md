Welcome to the GPT Dungeon Master repository! This project harnesses the power of GPT models to create a dynamic and responsive Dungeon Master (DM) for tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). Whether you're a seasoned player looking for a quick rule reference or a group in need of an AI-driven DM for your next adventure, the GPT Dungeon Master is here to guide you.

## Features
**Knowledgebase Integration:** Access a vast digital library of RPG rulebooks. Get instant answers to rule queries, character abilities, and more.
**Dynamic Storytelling:** Let the GPT model craft intricate narratives, describe vivid settings, and generate unexpected plot twists.
**Rule Enforcement:** Ensure your gameplay adheres to the rules. The system checks player actions against the rulebook, ensuring a fair and consistent gaming experience.
**Interactive UI:** Engage with the GPT DM through a user-friendly interface. Input actions, ask questions, and immerse yourself in the game.
