# Game play mechanics


There should be a reputation system in the game. The player should be able to gain or lose reputation based on their actions. The reputation system should affect how NPCs interact with the player. For example, if the player has a high reputation, NPCs should be more likely to help the player. If the player has a low reputation, NPCs should be more likely to attack the player.
